    <p>This app is made for visually impared people to Detect Pakistani Currency note values also if the currency note is not
        properly visible in camera then app will speak for navigations. Once the note appears properly in 
        camera then image is auto captured and results will be spoken out by Text To Speech engine on
         android.

    <p>This app was one of my first project in Freelance that I have developed in my career so the coding styling
        and logics are very poor but you can have an Idea about it. 
        I used OCR to detect texts on currency note and compared with the data simply to achieve this.
